# Go Practical Feasibility Probes

These are private feasibility/audit tools. They register no profile, add no
public command, and cannot establish a program proof by themselves.

## T01-W01 baseline audit

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 develop/probes/go-practical/entry_audit.py --check
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s develop/probes/go-practical -p 'test_entry_audit.py' -v
```

The audit checks the last installed-release receipt against the raw registered
bytes, pins its Go toolchain metadata and specification witnesses, checks the
fixed Go corpus's indexed artifact hashes, and inventories initial consumers
and regression files. It does not execute the Linux compiler or verify all
application theorems. Its historical receipt does not certify later source
changes. The ledger records the separate clean Git baseline check; the audit
does not invoke Git.

`--write` deliberately regenerates the report only while establishing W01.
After production changes, retain the original hashes and compare against a
checkout of the recorded baseline; do not rewrite them to make drift pass.
Tests corrupt receipt state, registry identity, target width, language
versions, artifact digests, negative-case coverage, and duplicate JSON keys.

The proposed effective-language-version table is go1.22–go1.25. T01-W02 must
probe it using the exact Go 1.25.0 analysis release before T01-W04 can freeze
admission. Host Go 1.23.2 regression results are explicitly separate evidence.
